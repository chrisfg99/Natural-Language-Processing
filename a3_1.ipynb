Multiplying these values to gether gives us the first values for this problem being 0.0113 for it being Verb and 0.0004 for it being ProperNoun and 0 for it being an Adjective. Taking this into account means that we will take verb as the starting point and move on to Alice's probabilities of being assigned Verb, ProperNoun and Adjective being V:0, PN:0.266 and A:0. The next stage is to go through all nine possibilities of which tag is most likely to proceed each tag and multiply this value by the probability of the tag being assigned to the word. Using this we can then determine the most likey tag to be assigned to 'Alice'. After these calculations the best method is a ProperNoun being assigned to 'Alice' following Verb that was assigned to 'said'. This process then continues for 'indignantly' and then for the end.\n",

    "After all this the optimal solution is unsuprisingly Verb, ProperNoun, Adjective with a probability of 4.2824e-9 of this sequence occuring.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is better than brute forcing methods as you don't have to consider everysingle possibility as if you come across a tag that has 0 probability of being assigned to a word then that is three routes that don't have to be considered, in the case of my example. This therefore lowers the running the time of the algorithm and makes its execution much more efficent especially when you don't have to test each combination to check whether it works."
